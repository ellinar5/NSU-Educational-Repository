-- scientific conference on robotics --


1. Прочитал/ла научную статью по теме троектория движения роботов. What robots with Point-to-Point path do you know? (1 вопрос)

2.Ответ на вопрос (можно взять из текста): I know that many pick-and-place robots use the Point-to-Point path. They move from one discrete location to another, typically to assemble parts or load materials.

1. That's interesting! What industrial robots are there beyond those? (2 вопрос)

2. Ответ на вопрос: There are several types of robots, for example, universal, that is, performing various types of operations, special, robotic manipulators and robots for machine maintenance.

1.You gave the example of a robot manipulator. It works on servo control. What else do you know about such robots? (3 вопрос)

2.Ответ на вопрос: Servo-controlled robots are equipped with sensors that continuously monitor their position and velocity, allowing for precise control. This feedback allows them to adapt and respond to their environment effectively.

1. Got it! What robots with Controlled path can you name? (4 вопрос)
