Steve Fossett was always looking for adventure, even as a boy in the 1950s. After some years in business, he (0) began his well-known adventures, from swimming the English Channel to sailing around the world. But Fossett is best known for his adventures in the air - in hot-air balloons, gliders, and light aircraft. In 2005 he (1) broke the record for non-stop flying when he flew round the world in 67 hours without stopping for fuel. A year later, as he (2) attempted to break the record for the longest flight, he had to stop because part of his engine had failed - but he broke the record, anyway.

Fossett's adventures often put him in danger - in 1998, while he (3) was traveling around the world in a balloon, he almost died (4) when the balloon fell from the sky. In the end, it was a routine flight that (5) took his life - he was flying a small plane across the Nevada Desert in September 2007 when he (6) disappeared. No one could find him, then, some months later, a hiker (7) was walking through the mountains in southern California when he (8) noticed some personal items which (9) belonged to the adventurer, and soon afterwards a search party (10) found the wreckage of the plane. Some time later, Fossett's body was found - his adventures were over.
