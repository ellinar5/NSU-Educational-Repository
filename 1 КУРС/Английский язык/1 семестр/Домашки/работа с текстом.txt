краткая информация:

Cartesian Robots  
Cartesian robots, also known as linear manipulators, move in straight lines along three mutually perpendicular axes corresponding to Cartesian coordinates (X, Y, Z). They are commonly used in automated manufacturing processes for tasks like packaging, assembly, and material handling. Advantages include simple construction, high precision, and easy integration into existing production lines.

Redundant Robots  
Redundant robots possess more degrees of freedom than required for specific tasks, allowing them to avoid obstacles and choose optimal paths. This adaptability enhances maneuverability and reduces the risk of entrapment. They are widely utilized in complex manipulations, such as surgical robots and research applications. Redundancy also improves positioning accuracy while reducing mechanical stress.

Activity 6. Read the text and check your ideas.
Industrial Robots
Industrial robots are programmable multifunctional mechanical devices designed
to move material, parts, tools, or specialized devices through variable programmed
motions to perform a variety of tasks. An industrial robot system includes not only
industrial robots but also any devices and/or sensors required for the robot to perform
its tasks as well as sequencing or monitoring communication interfaces.
All industrial robots are either servo or non-servo controlled. Servo robots
are controlled through the use of sensors that
continually monitor the robot's axes
and associated components for position and velocity. This feedback is compared to
pre-taught information which has been programmed and stored in the robot's
memory. Non-servo robots do not have the feedback capability, and their axes are
controlled through a system of mechanical stops and limit switches.
Industrial robots can be programmed from a distance to perform their
required and preprogrammed operations with different types of paths generated
through different control techniques. The three different types of paths generated
are point-to-point path, controlled path, and continuous
path.
Point-to-Point Path. Robots programmed and controlled in this manner are
programmed to move from one discrete point to another within the robot's working
envelope. In the automatic mode of operation, the exact path taken by the robot
will vary slightly due to variations in velocity, joint geometries, and point spatial
locations. This difference in paths is difficult to predict and therefore can create a
potential safety hazard to personnel and equipment.
Controlled Path. The path or mode of movement ensures that the end of the
robot's arm will follow a predictable path and orientation as the robot travels from
point to point. The coordinate transformations required for this hardware
management are calculated by the robot's control system computer. Observations
that result from this type of programming are less likely to present a hazard to
personnel and equipment.
