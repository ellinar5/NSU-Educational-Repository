Job Interview
Good morning, Miss Jones. So you applied for a job in our team. Am I right?

Yes, I did. I sent my resume for a position of a restaurant manager.

That's good. I'd like to know a bit more about you. Probably you could tell us about your education first.

Well, I left school at 17 and then for the next five years I studied at Kazan Federal University. graduated the Department of economics with high honors and was qualified as a manager of enterprise. And after that I did a one-year computer course.

Well. Your education sounds great, Miss Jones. And have you got any experience? Have you worked
before?
Certainly. First I worked as a manager at children's clothes shop. I stayed there for four years and
•
then I
moved on to my present company. They offered me a job of a manager in a big cafe.
That's very interesting. Why aren't you happy with your present job, Miss Jones? Why are you going to
leave them?
•
Well. The salary isn't so bad, I must admit. But the work schedule isn't convenient for me. And I
do a lot of overtime there. Besides you have an excellent reputation and I hope to have more
often
opportunity and growth potential in your company.
I see. Do you mind business trips? And are you fluent in Italian or German?
•
Oh, foreign languages are my favorites. We did Italian and German at the University and I use them
when I travel.
• Very good. Can you tell me about your good points then?
• Well… I start my work on time. I learn rather quickly. I am friendly and I am able to work under
pressure in a busy company.
OK. That's enough I think. Well, Miss Jones. Thank you very much. I am pleased to talk to you and
shall inform you about the result of our interview in a few days. Good-bye.
