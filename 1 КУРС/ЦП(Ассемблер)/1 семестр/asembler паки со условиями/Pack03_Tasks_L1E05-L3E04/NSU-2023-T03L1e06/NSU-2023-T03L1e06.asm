# INSERT YOUR CODE BELOW
# Executable instructions only
# No dc or ds pseudo-instructions
# Do not include a halt instruction: that has been done already (below)

# =================================
# LEAVE THIS PART OF THE FILE ALONE
# Do not change the next two instructions: they must be the last two
# instructions executed by your program.
    ldi r0, pos  # Loads the start address of your result into r0 for the robot
    halt         # Brings execution to a halt

# =================================
# DATA GOES BELOW
# We have set this up for you, but you will need to test your program by
# compiling and running it several times with different input data values
# (different arrays of numbers)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
